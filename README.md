# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my unofficial Cybersecurity portfolio under construction. 

# Who Am I?
I am a Cybersecurity Specialist from Orange County, California. I graduated from UC Irvine's
Cybersecurity Boot Camp in the winter of 2021, and I am currently in the process of earning my Bachelor's Degree in Cybersecurity. My background entails several years of combined experience in healthcare as a licensed registered respiratory therapist (RRT), and account management for a corporation that served as a middleman between life insurance companies and medical care facilities, not limited to private practices and hospitals. I have great
understanding of HIPAA laws and the importance of protecting sensitive PII and data. I have
a mentality that enjoys serving the public for the greater good, and that includes protecting their sensitive data and privacy.

# Interests
My interests are emphasized in offensive security as my main focus e.g., Penetration Testing. I am fascinated with the penetration of networks, and using strategic and creative thinking to find ways to intrude them if they are indeed penetrable. Web application security is very intriguing to me as well, and I truly enjoy hacking deliberately insecure servers such as the OWASP WebGoat to gain more understanding of web app security.
