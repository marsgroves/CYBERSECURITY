# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my unofficial Cybersecurity portfolio under construction. 

# Who Am I?
Hello! I am Mars Groves. I am an Asian-American nonbinary (he/she him/her) member of the LGBTQIA community who is a strong BIPOC ally who currently resides in the Orange County area of Southern California.

I am a Cybersecurity Specialist. I recently graduated from UC Irvine's Cybersecurity Boot Camp in the winter of 2021, and I am currently in the process of earning my Bachelor's Degree in Cybersecurity. I am also studying for the Security+ exam that I have scheduled to take in late April.

My background entails several years of combined experience in healthcare as a licensed registered respiratory therapist (RRT), and account management for a corporation that served as a middleman between life insurance companies and medical care facilities, not limited to private practices and hospitals. I have great
understanding of HIPAA laws and the importance of protecting sensitive PII and data. I have
a mentality that enjoys serving the public for the greater good, and that includes protecting their sensitive data and privacy.

# Interests
My interests are emphasized in offensive security as my main focus e.g., Penetration Testing. I am fascinated with the penetration of networks, and using strategic and creative thinking to find ways to intrude them if they are indeed penetrable. Web application security is very intriguing to me as well for similar reasons, and I truly enjoy hacking deliberately insecure servers such as the OWASP WebGoat to gain more understanding of web app security. 

I also have a deep appreciation for bug bounty hunting as well, and I aim to become more knowledgeable in finding bugs. My interests also lie in secure coding of web applications, and the analysis of malware which is very complex but captivates my curiosity. Blockchains, drones, and AI/Machine Learning are also interesting to me. I am a fan of technology. :)

# Products Used
Primarily Kali Linux inside of a virtual environment. I enjoy using its security tools such as Metasploit, Nmap, Zenmap, john the ripper, Wireshark, and more. Practicing penetration testing with Hack The Box is my cup of tea (or coffee)! :) However, I do have understanding of Splunk and ELK/Kibana e.g., Filebeat, Metricbeat for monitoring logs and creating alerts and dashboards. I have knowledge of Snort and Sguil including Autopsy for forensics.

# Team
Red Team baby! I am a Red Teamer at heart, but since I am open to working with Blue Teams,
I may consider myself as a Purple Teamer someday! :)
