Hello there! :)

Thank you for visiting my GitHub!


My name is Mars Groves, and I'm a Cybersecurity Analyst who wears many hats at WEBGAP since 2021. 

I am also the Editor and Contributing Writer for Secjuice, the non-profit Cybersecurity publication.

Prior to working in Cybersecurity, I worked in healthcare as a Respiratory Therapist saving lives.


Most of my work involves analysis, business intelligence, OSINT + HUMINT, deployments, and writing articles.

I have a strong interest in areas of pentesting, all things blockchain related, aerospace, and finance. 

My strongest suit is performing deep research, analysis, and writing comprehensive papers on anything.

I would love to operate a SOC and/or work as an analyst for a social media giant to level up my abilities.


Apart from analysis, I highly enjoy hacking away on my terminal with my labs using Linux and breaking my Raspberry Pi!

I am training myself to advance my ethical hacking abilities via THM courses, HTB, and TryHackMe, etc.

I would love to work as a pentester for a bank, satellite company, or blockchain/crypto group one day.

Currently, I am teaching myself how to code as well because I strongly believe it's a useful skillâ€“and it's fun. 


My fascinations revolve around all things futuristic related: Web3, AI, IoTs, biotech, the metaverse, etc.

I'm a creative and tech-savvy person at heart who loves people, enjoys meditation, and can lighten the eNerGy.

My interpersonal and collaborative abilities come naturally, which makes me very easygoing and fun to work with.


Lastly, I am non-binary and my pronouns are He/Him or She/Her (anything but They/Them) depending on how you view me.

I am also a Filipino-American, and I can speak four languages. I grew up in a middle to lower class PoC neighborhood.

I am a strong BIPOC and LGBTQ ally. Therefore, working with groups that value diversity is very important to me. :)
