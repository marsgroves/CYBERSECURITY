# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my unofficial Cybersecurity portfolio under construction. 

# Who Am I?
Hello! I am Mars Groves. I am an Asian-American nonbinary (he/she him/her) member of the LGBTQIA community who is also a strong BIPOC ally. I currently reside in the Orange County area of Southern California, which is between Los Angeles and San Diego.

I am a Cybersecurity Specialist. I recently graduated from UC Irvine's Cybersecurity Boot Camp in the early winter of 2021, and I am currently in the process of earning my Bachelor's Degree in Cybersecurity. I am also studying for the Security+ exam at the present time which I have scheduled to take in late April, and I am holding weekly study group sessions 3x/week for it.

My background entails several years of combined experience in healthcare as a licensed registered respiratory therapist (RRT), and account management for a corporation that served as a middleman between life insurance companies and medical care facilities, not limited to private practices and hospitals. As well as a creative technical background in TV/video production and audio engineering/music production. I have great understanding of HIPAA laws and the importance of protecting sensitive PII and data. I have a mentality that enjoys serving the public for the greater good, and that includes protecting the sensitive data and privacy of people and/or their organizations.

# Interests
My interests are emphasized in offensive security as my main focus e.g., Penetration Testing. I am fascinated with the penetration of networks, and using strategic and creative thinking to find ways to intrude them if they are indeed penetrable. Web application security is very intriguing to me too for similar reasons, and I truly enjoy hacking  insecure servers such as the OWASP WebGoat for practice and to gain more understanding of web app security. 

I have a fondness for bug bounty hunting too, and I am currently learning more about it and aim to become more knowledgeable in finding bugs. I love CTF challenges! My interests also lie in secure coding of web applications, and the analysis of malware which is very complex but captivates my curiosity. Security research and reading detailed whitepapers are very fun to me! I aim to become a writer and researcher in the field someday. Blockchains, drones, and AI/Machine Learning are also interesting to me. I am a fan of technology. :)

Aside from the tech-oriented interests of mine, I'm an avid reader who enjoys reading non-fiction books aside from infosec textbooks from No Starch Press. :) I practice mindfulness meditation on a daily basis and write in my journal

# Products Used
Primarily Kali Linux inside of a virtual environment. I enjoy using its security tools such as Metasploit, Nmap, Zenmap, john the ripper, Wireshark, and more. Practicing penetration testing with Hack The Box is my cup of tea (or coffee)! :) However, I do have understanding of Splunk and ELK/Kibana e.g., Filebeat, Metricbeat for monitoring logs and creating alerts and dashboards. I have knowledge of Snort and Sguil including Autopsy for forensics.

# Team
Red Team baby! I am a Red Teamer at heart, but since I am open to working with Blue Teams,
I may consider myself as a Purple Teamer someday! :)
