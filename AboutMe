Hello everyone! :)

My name is Mars. Thank you for coming to my GitHub!

I'm a Cybersecurity Specialist. My interests are Penetration Testing, Bug Bounty Hunting,
and Web App hacking. Go Red Team! I'm currently in the process of earning my Security+ cert,
and I look forward to polishing my penetration testing skills and get OSCP certified.

I am currently practicing with Hack The Box, and I am taking networking courses to establish
a greater understanding of networks.
