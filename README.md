Hello there! :) Thank you for visiting my GitHub!


# whoami

My name is <b>Mars Groves</b>, and I'm a <b>Cybersecurity Analyst</b> who wears many hats at WEBGAP since 2021.
<br>
I am also the <b>Editor</b> and <b>Contributing Writer</b> for Secjuice, the non-profit Cybersecurity publication.
<br>
Occasionally, I will provide undisclosed Cybersecurity services for freelance and contract work for clients. <br>
Prior to working in Cybersecurity, I worked in healthcare as a Respiratory Therapist saving lives during code blues.
<br><br>
# Cyber Skills
<b>Technical experience</b> <br>
Kali Linux, Nmap, WPSCan, Wireshark, MetaSploit, Hashcat, SecurityOnion, ELK, Splunk, Sumo Logic. 
<br>OSINT tools I've used: Spiderfoot, Maltego, Shodan, recon-ng, Google dorking. I love the Geoguessr game.<br>
I have done forensics with the Autopsy Sleuthkit investigating iPhones for a project.
<br><br>
<i>*Yes, I can work the terminal on Linux distros, Windows, and Mac OS (Unix). I can also deploy a virtual machine within VirtualBox Oracle VM, Microsoft Remote Desktop, Azure, Google Cloud Provider, and AWS.</i> <br><br>
<b>Education</b><br>
I received Cybersecurity training at <b>UC Irvine</b> in their <b>Cybersecurity Bootcamp</b> where I earned a <b>Certificate</b>. I hold an <b>A.S. Degree</b> in <b>Respiratory Therapy</b> and am working to earn my Bachelor's of Science in Cybersecurity. 
<br><br>
<b>Labs are fun!</b><br>
I love creating home <b>labs</b> and tinkering with my <b>Raspberry Pi</b> as well as getting hands-on experience via courses, platforms, and workshops such as: The Cyber Mentor's and Phillip Wylie's courses, Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and Cover6 solutions' workshops etc. I have participated in a handful of CTF challenges, and won 1st place in one.
<br><br>
# People and Personality</b><br>
<b>People skills</b>
<br>Team building and collaboration in a healthcare environment, managing teams in an office, conflict resolution in the workplace, investor relations and seed fundraising, customer relations (insurance agents and brokers), and <b>social engineering</b>, just to name some examples. My interpersonal skills are strong and people often seek counsel from me. Additionally, I love people from all walks of life and am very easygoing to work with in groups. Humor is my love language, and I love hooking up my onsite teams with donuts, food, and coffee :)<br><br>
<b>Strong suits</b><br>
Analytical skills, finding errors in small details (editor mindset), writing comprehensive reports and documentation, fast fingers which come in handy when typing and navigating the terminal, interpersonal skills, and creative abilities which includes coming up with new ideas. I've been involved with music production, film, art, and especially writing since I was a kid as my lifelong hobbies. Friends in creative lines of work seek me for ideas.
<br><br>Communication comes naturally to me. I can break down a complex concept into a simple analogy. 

<br>
<b>Personality</b><br>
Think of light ocean blue colors that are peaceful, zen, riding out the waves and flowing with the tides. That is my core personality. I am easygoing to work with and am very flexible. Humor and generosity are my love languages :) <br><br>

My drive, determination, and passion look like a mix of scarlet red colors and warm, bright orange flames. I have a persistent personality that <u>doesn't</u> give up in the face of adversity, and I am not easily discouraged by failures either but am rather fueled by them instead.

I'm a firm believer that <i>you're always winning when you're always learning.</i> 
<br><br>
# Cybersecurity Interests <br>
<i>Penetration testing, writing and research, building and breaking labs, and AppSec are honestly my key interests. Currently, I am teaching myself how to code because coding is a valuable skill, and I want to build an app.</i>


<b>Fields to Work For</b><br>
I am very curious about working in cybersecurity for <i>all things blockchain related, FinTech and banking, aerospace/drones, medical device companies, EV automotive, energy utilities, and social media giants.</i> 

<b>Jobs I'm Interested In</b><br>
Analyst, SOC operative work, and technical writing. As I continue to hone my ethical hacking skills, pentesting work may become my main focus later down the road. I will even entertain an internship in coding just to gain valuable experience that can be applicable to AppSec as well.


<b>Curiosities</b><br>
All things technologically futuristic ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; Blockchain, Web3, AI, IoTs, biotech, the metaverse, EV, drones, and more.</b>
<br><br>
# Hacker, builder, and creator of things.

I'm a creative and tech-savvy person at heart. I enjoy hacking, learning code, trading, making music on Ableton Live, tinkering with my Raspberry Pi, building labs and PCs, editing films, and enjoying art. I am also an avid non-fiction reader. Black Mirror is one of my favorite shows. As a toddler, I was the kid who would take apart broken electronics just to see what they look like inside and would figure out how they work then fix them.
<br><br>
# Lover of people
I love people from all walks of life, enjoy having conversations with people, and naturally work well with teams. 

My interpersonal and collaborative abilities are very natural, which makes me very easygoing and fun to work with. I am also trained in managing conflict resolution in a work environment.
<br><br>
# Diversity is cool
I am <b>non-binary</b> and my pronouns are He/Him or She/Her depending on how you view me.<br>
I am also a <b>Filipino-American</b>. I practice <b>Tibetan Buddhism</b>. And I speak four languages.<br>
I grew up in a middle-to-lower class PoC neighborhood with a single mom and struggled. <br>It is my goal to one day give back to the less privileged who want to get into cybersecurity. <br><br>I love engaging with diverse groups because there is lots to learn from different perspectives. <br>I can appreciate other cultures and enjoy trying out different foods and traveling to places. <br>
I am a strong BIPOC and LGBTQ ally, and human rights are important to me. Equality for all!

<i>Working with groups that value diversity are an A++ in my book!</i> :)
