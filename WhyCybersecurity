Cybersecurity is important in our age of information. There are approximately 2,244 cyber attacks on a daily basis. 
More and more businesses, financial institutions, hospitals, and other organizations in our infrastructures are becoming impacted as a result.
As the global pandemic continues to impact our society since 2020, cyber attacks are also on the rise. 
One of the biggest factors that have resulted in an increase in cyber attacks is the fact that an increase of jobs allow its employees to work from home.
This allows a greater opportunity for bad actors to initialize cyber attacks across a variety of networks.
