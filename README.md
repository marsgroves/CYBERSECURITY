# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hello everyone! :)

My name is Mars. Thank you for coming to my GitHub!

I'm an Information Security Analyst. I am a graduate of UC Irvine's Cybersecurity bootcamp
(class of '21) where I first gained technical knowledge and acquired technical skills in
Offensive and Defensive security. I am non-binary (pronouns He/Him or She/Her) and an
Asian-American who is a strong BIPOC ally and part of the LGBTQ community. I am also 
multilingual and love diverse groups. 

In addition, I have a background in healthcare in Respiratory Therapy (changed industries) 
and truly shine in areas that require teamwork, empathy, commmunication, and helping others. 
I am no stranger to handling emergencies and triaging.

After graduating from the bootcamp, I continued my education by reading books, participating 
in Cybersecurity events and with my local chapters (OWASP, ISSA, Women's Cyberjutsu etc), 
watching live streamed talks, participating in CTF challenges, including actively engaging 
in technical workshops such as the SOC Analyst Workshop by Cover6 Solutions lead by one of 
my mentors, Tyrone Wilson. Then I landed an internship and role as an InfoSec analyst for 
a private company. Currently, I'm in the process of earning my Bachelor's Degree in 
Cybersecurity at WGU, and expanding my technical skills and knowledge to share it.

ðŸ‘‰ I have technical experience with the following:
<br>-Navigating the Linux command line (ifconfig anyone? :])
<br>-Kali Linux
<br>-Wireshark
<br>-SecurityOnion
<br>-Snort
<br>-Elastic Kibana (Check out how I built my ELK stack here )
<br>-Splunk
<br>-Sumo Logic
<br>-OSINT tools: Spiderfoot, Maltego, Shodan, recon-ng, Google dorking etc.
<br>-Penetration Testing tools: Nmap, Zenmap, MetaSploit, WPSCan, wafw00f, etc.
<br>Check out this project I did with my team at UCI Cybersecurity Bootcamp using WPScan:

<br>-Autopsy Sleuthkit (did a project doing forensics on an iPhone using Autopsy)

ðŸ‘‰ Scripts I am familiar with and/or have used:
<br>-Bash
<br>-AWK
<br>-Python (in the process of earning my Google Python certification)
-C+ (learning from a mentor)

*Note: AppSec is indeed an interest of mine and I expect to gain more knowledge in coding
as I take advantage of free resources on CourseEra, Google, freecodecamp.org, and my 
lovely mentors etc.

ðŸ‘‰ OS Environments:
<br>-Unix 
<br>-Linux (Ubuntu, Kali Linux)
<br>-Windows

ðŸ‘‰ Cloud Environments:
-Azure (I have primarily used the Azure environment)

*Note: I would love to explore AWS and GCP in a work environment if given the opportunity. 
I am considering gaining certification in AWS or Google Cloud Provider.

ðŸ‘‰ Certifications:
<br>-UCI Bootcamp Cybersecurity certificate. Badges: Defensive Security, Networking and Network
Security, Offensive Security and Penetration Testing, Systems Administration. See LinkedIn

<br>-Network+ and Security+ (in process and studying with study groups)
<br>-MITRE ATT&CK Fundamentals
<br>-SOC Analyst Prep by Cover6Solutions

ðŸ‘‰ Areas of interest:
Analysis, penetration testing, web application hacking, AppSec, coding, aerospace, and FinTech. 

*Note: The Aerospace Village at DEFCON in Vegas this August 2021 was my absolute favorite.
I had no idea aerospace would capture my heart until I learned more about drone hacking from
DARPA (drone fan here) and the major concern of satellites getting hacked (see Hack A Sat 2). 

My second favorite was the Cryptocurrency Village due to my enthusiasm for FinTech and the
development of blockchain technologies. 

ðŸ‘‰ Home Labs:
<br>-I have built a home lab environment e.g., Kali Linux using Oracle VM Virtual Box
<br>-Raspberry Pi vulnerable server project is in process
<br>-Building a drone (aiming to get Part 107 UAS license too) to experiment with penetration
testing with it.

ðŸ‘‰ Hacking Activities:
<br>-TryHackMe
<br>-CTF challenges (won 1st place team in a CTF, participated in NahamCon and others)
<br>-HackTheBox (simple walkthrough video I did here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t8Mt8wVgiY)

ðŸ‘‰ Cybersecurity Community:
<br>-Secjuice (I volunteer to write Cybersecurity articles and curate InfoSec news).
<br>-Active on Twitter following and interacting with many Cybersecurity industry pros.
<br>-Active on LinkedIn following Cybersecurity leaders
<br>-I'm a member of local chapters of OWASP, Women's Cyberjutsu, ISSA, ISACA, WiCys groups.
<br>-Actively participate in events such as DEFCON, BlackHat, and virtual conferences too.
<br>-Help fellow peers interested in InfoSec and I have InfoSec mentors I regularly talk to

Make clear, I am highly enthusiastic about the Cybersecurity space, and I look forward to
learning more and advancing my knowledge to share it with the community!
<br>
<br>
<b>A Happy Hacker,</b>
<br>Mars Groves
